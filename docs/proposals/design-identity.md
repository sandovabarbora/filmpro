## 1. Design Philosophy

FILMPRO's design is driven by the needs of film production professionals who require clear, efficient interfaces that present complex information in an easily digestible format. The application prioritizes:

- **Clarity over decoration** - Clean layouts that prioritize information hierarchy
- **Density with readability** - Information-dense screens that remain scannable
- **Functional aesthetics** - Visually pleasing but never at the expense of usability
- **Technical precision** - Monospaced typography that supports detailed production data
- **Reduced eye strain** - Dark theme optimized for both on-set and office environments

The interface balances the technical requirements of production management with an aesthetic that feels appropriate for creative professionals.

## 3. Typography

### Font Family

The entire application uses **JetBrains Mono**, a monospaced font that provides:

- Technical precision for values, times, and measurements
- Clear readability for complex production information
- Distinct characters that reduce reading errors in critical data
- Consistent spacing for tabular data and code-like elements

### Type Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Case | Color |
|---------|------|--------|------|-------|
| Page Titles | 18px (1.125rem) | Medium (500) | Normal | `#E2E4ED` |
| Section Headers | 16px (1rem) | Medium (500) | Normal | `#E2E4ED` |
| Card Titles | 14px (0.875rem) | Medium (500) | Normal | `#E2E4ED` |
| Body Text | 14px (0.875rem) | Regular (400) | Normal | `#E2E4ED` |
| Secondary Text | 13px (0.8125rem) | Regular (400) | Normal | `#6D7183` |
| Small/Caption | 12px (0.75rem) | Regular (400) | Normal | `#6D7183` |
| Labels/Categories | 11px (0.6875rem) | Medium (500) | Uppercase | `#6D7183` |

### Typographic Rules

- Line height: 1.5 for body text, 1.3 for headings
- Letter spacing: Default for most text, +0.05em for labels and uppercase text
- Text truncation: Ellipsis for single-line truncation, line clamping for multi-line
- Number formatting: Consistent decimal places and thousand separators
- Date formatting: Consistent "MMM D, YYYY" format (e.g., "Mar 27, 2025")

## 9. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use CSS variables for all colors and spacing
- Component-based architecture for all UI elements
- Support dark mode only (no light mode variant)
- Implement responsive designs using Tailwind breakpoints
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate focus states

### Accessibility Considerations

- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA compliance)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management for modals and complex widgets
- Text alternatives for all visual information

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading for off-screen content
- Image optimization for thumbnails and previews
- Code splitting for page-specific components
- Virtualization for long lists and data tables
- Memoization for expensive calculations and renders
