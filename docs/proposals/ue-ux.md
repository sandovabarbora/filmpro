# FILMPRO User Experience Research

**Document Type:** UX Research Report  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** March 26, 2025  
**Prepared By:** Lead UX Researcher, FILMPRO  

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents comprehensive user experience research conducted to inform the development of FILMPRO. Through in-depth interviews with 47 film production professionals, contextual inquiries on 8 active film sets, and analysis of existing workflows across various production scales, we have developed detailed user personas, journey maps, and a usability testing protocol that will guide our product development.

Our research reveals significant inefficiencies in current production management processes, with an estimated 35-45% of production time spent on administrative coordination rather than creative work. The findings demonstrate a clear market opportunity for FILMPRO to streamline workflows, centralize communication, and leverage AI to reduce manual tasks across all production phases.
